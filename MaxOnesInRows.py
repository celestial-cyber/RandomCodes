"""Algorithm

Observation:

Each row is sorted (0 â€¦ 0 1 â€¦ 1).

So if we find the first 1 in a row, the number of 1s = M - index_of_first_1.

Approach 1 (Binary Search, O(N log M))

For each row, use binary search to find the first 1.

Compute count of 1s.

Keep track of max count and row index.

Approach 2 (Optimized, O(N + M))

Start from top-right corner of the matrix.

If we see 1, move left (this row may have more 1s).

If we see 0, move down.

Track the row index where we moved leftmost â†’ that row has maximum 1s.

ðŸ‘‰ Weâ€™ll use Approach 2 because itâ€™s faster.

ðŸ”¹ Time Complexity

Each step moves either left or down, at most N + M steps.

So complexity = O(N + M).

Space = O(1)."""
